It contains example pipelines and minimal code necessary for:
1. Isolating non-Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome from biorrefinary data;
2. Read-based analisis of the contaminants reads;
3. Statistical analisis using R.

These scripts may be used for similar inference of population dynamics 
from metagenomic data of microbial populations. However, it is not readily 
portable and would need to be appropriately edited. See research article 
for details on the inference steps.

Raw sequencing reads were uploaded to NCBI SRA under accession PRJNA865262.
